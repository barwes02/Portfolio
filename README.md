# Portfolio

This is my Portofolio Application where I display all my current projects and details about myself. It was created using React.js for the front-end and php with laravel for the back-end. Even though the website is static at the moment and wouldn't necessarily need a back-end at this time, I plan on expanding it in the future with the more work I do.
